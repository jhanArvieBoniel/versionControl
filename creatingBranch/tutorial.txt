Cloning repository from github to local
git-bash to window
1. mkdir projectFolder (create folder)
2. cd projectFolder  (to direct on the folder)
3. git clone "Then paste the HTTPs URL from GITHUB" (to clone the project to local from hithub)
4. cd nameOfDirectory   (go to the directory)
5. ls -la               (flag -la means list all)
6. git status           (display which branch im on)
7 touch text.txt        (to add file)
8. git status           (to check if there is changes or untracked file)
9. git add text.txt     (to commit the file)
10. git add .           (to commit all)
11. git restore --stage test.txt (untracked or removing the file)
12. git commit -m "sample message" (-m flag is for adding message to the commit file then press return)
13. git push            (will push the commit to the server)

CREATING Branch on github
this is better than the team working on the main branch
1. pwd                  (checking directory)
2. git status           (to check if the if directory is empty or clear)
3. git checkout -B sample/branch    (-B is for creating branch + directory and go directly in it.)
4.                      (creating another branch that MAIN means working on another branch on git so that conflict can avoid and reviewing are possible before adding to main branch)
5. git branch           (verifying if ther is the new branch)
6.                      (remember. Main branch is not knowledgable of new branch and is isolated)
7. touch test2.txt      (sample created file in the created branch)
8. git add test2.txt    (add the file) 
9. git commit -m "added"(then commit the new file)
10 git push -u origin sample/branch (-u is getting update from main branch and move on the created branch)
11.                     (pressing enter will promted to login information)
12.                     (github will recognize that new branch has been added)
13.                     (OPEN github/repository then click on "compare and pull request")
14.                     (pull request purpose is to obtain a preview/review of the created branch in github to validate the changes)
15.                     (compare the main and created branch: commit, file changes, etc)
16.                     (click "Create pull request" the team will review the changes, approved or declined)
17.                     (click "Merge pull request" after the team review it)
18.                     (click "Confirm merge")
19.                     (Choose if you want to delete or keep the created branch)
20. git status          (is there more to commit?. Also check the branch you are working)
21. git checkout main   (switching to main and checking files)
22. git pull            (checking the changes)
23. ls                  (another way of checking the files in the branch)Â„
